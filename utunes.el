;;; Commentary:

;; ÂµTunes attempts to replace major functionality of a full-featured
;; music library manager such as iTunes with an absolute minimum
;; number of lines of code. The interface, as such, is designed to
;; maximize flexibility while minimizing implementation complexity and
;; number of abstractions.

;; Please see <https://github.com/raxod502/utunes> for more
;; information.
